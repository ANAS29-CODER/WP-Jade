== Description ==

The plugin allows to display selected ACF fields or Posts anywhere using shortcodes, HTML markup is created automatically by the plugin.

Note: "ACF Views" plugin requires [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin to be enabled on your website (either Free or Pro version).

== ðŸŒŸ Display ACF fields and Posts ==

Solve all these scenarios without coding.

* [Display ACF fields on a page](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/display-fields-on-a-single-page)
E.g. add multiple ACF fields to the homepage and display them

* [Display specific posts (built-in or CPT) in a grid or list beautifully](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-cards/basic/display-multiple-posts-and-their-fields)
E.g. display the latest WooCommerce products with their ACF fields

* [Display specific post or CPT item with its fields](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/display-custom-post-and-its-fields)
E.g. display "sponsor" CPT item on another post/page

* [Display specific ACF fields for all items of a CPT](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/display-fields-for-a-custom-post-type)
E.g. display multiple ACF fields for all WooCommerce products

Nearly all plugins use Custom Post Types (CPT) to store their data. Plugins like WooCommerce call it Products, whatever they're called the ACF Views plugin supports it all.

== ðŸ•— Less time with less effort ==

Better than coding. See why [here](https://wplake.org/blog/display-acf-fields-beautifully-and-without-coding/).

* Select fields from a list, no need to worry about their names and return types
* Markup auto generated uses BEM method to avoid conflicts
* UI to define selection filters, no need to worry about DB query arguments
* Editing theme templates via FTP is in the past
* CSS and JS code can be added without hassle
* Built-in features, like pagination to save hours of coding

== ðŸ’¡ How it works ==

View for ACF fields
Create a View and assign one or more custom fields, our plugin then generates a shortcode that youâ€™ll use to display the field values to users. Style the output with the CSS field included in every View.

Card for post selections
Create a Card and assign posts (or CPT items), choose a View (that will be used to display each item) and our plugin generates a shortcode that youâ€™ll use to display the set of posts. The list of posts can be assigned manually or dynamically with filters.

== ðŸ“š Extensive Docs and Friendly Support ==

Our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieu3Mk2Ah0A&list=PL4WYpE2DYvTyzk1DtNhXJ4BXRjtIndht3) showcases the use of our plugin and its features, making it easier for new users to get started. See our [Docs](https://docs.acfviews.com/getting-started/acf-views-plugin-for-wordpress) for step by step guides and for information about customization.
Questions about the Basic ACF Views plugin are handled through the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/acf-views/). Customers with an active Pro license have personal support via our [support form](https://wplake.org/acf-views-support/).

== ðŸ“¢ Powerful features ==

* Display built-in post fields (like title or thumbnail) along with ACF fields
* Display post A in post B with its fields
* Define custom CSS and JS
* No style conflicts due to BEM method used
* Combine ACF fields from two different field groups
* Restrict visibility to specific user roles

== ðŸŽ¯ High Performance ==

Every wrapper has some overhead. We do our best to make this number as small as possible. One unique ACF View/Card on a page would only effect this by 0.01 seconds**\*** overhead compared to the usual way with coding. It's impossible to notice these tiny numbers visually without testing it.

= Custom fields not in the list of fields? =

Only fields created using the official Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin are compatible with ACF Views. See [here](https://docs.acfviews.com/getting-started/supported-field-types) for a list of supported field types.

= Can I Display User fields? =

Yes, you set up your field groups in ACF and assign those fields to your View, paste the shortcode in the target place, add the object-id="$user$" argument to the shortcode to display the fields from the current user. See [here](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/shortcode) for more about shortcode arguments.

= Fields have been assigned but the page doesn't show them =

Have you checked that the fields are filled in the target object? See [steps](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/creating-an-acf-view) for creating an ACF View.
